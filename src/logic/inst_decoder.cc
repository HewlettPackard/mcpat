   * Instruction decoder is different from n to 2^n decoders
   * that are commonly used in row decoders in memory arrays.
   * The RISC instruction decoder is typically a very simple device.
   * We can decode an instruction by simply
   * separating the machine word into small parts using wire slices
   * The RISC instruction decoder can be approximate by the n to 2^n decoders,
   * although this approximation usually underestimate power since each decoded
   * instruction normally has more than 1 active signal.
   *
   * However, decoding a CISC instruction word is much more difficult
   * than the RISC case. A CISC decoder is typically set up as a state machine.
   * The machine reads the opcode field to determine
   * what type of instruction it is,
   * and where the other data values are.
   * The instruction word is read in piece by piece,
   * and decisions are made at each stage as to
   * how the remainder of the instruction word will be read.
   * (sequencer and ROM are usually needed)
   * An x86 decoder can be even more complex since
   * it involve  both decoding instructions into u-ops and
   * merge u-ops when doing micro-ops fusion.
